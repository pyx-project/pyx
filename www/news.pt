        path elements has been enhanced considerably to prevent numerical
        instabilities. The data and style handling in the graph system has been
        completely reorganized. It is now possible to combine several graph
        styles within a single plot instruction.

      <dd>
        This release further improves the internal design and visible interfaces
        of PyX. The path system has undergone a major revision and cleanup.
        The graph module has been split into several smaller modules,
        reflecting its component architecture. Moreover, PyX now makes use of
        the attribute system introduced in the previous release. Graph styles
        and data handling have been largely revised. Major parts of the
        documentation have been rewritten and are now based on the standard
        Python documentation style. Bug-fixes and speed improvements complete
        this release.
