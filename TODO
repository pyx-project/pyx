Code:
- text module:
  - repair PDF generation with unincluded standard fonts (currently broken)
  - change DSC in PS fonts: Resource instead of Font (also in pswriter)
  - SlantFont & Co support
  - discuss reltransform: https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=9137692&forum_id=23700
  - add encoding; check whether encoding=ascii works well for the common existing cases
  - write graphics driver for pgf.sty from LaTeX
  - ignore "(Please type a command or say `\end')" in preamble method
  - properly handle file names with spaces in (like "C:\program files\texmf\tex\latex\base\article.cls" in
    texmessage.load
- graph.graph module
  - common bboxes for different graphs
  - circular graphs
  - axis painter labelattrs=None + automatic axis partitioning leads to no valid partitioning
  - when all titles are None, a graph key currently raises an exception
  - translatecanvas should be the default in graph.style.symbol
  - automatic scaling of y-axis according to subset of data shown on x-axis
  - graph.axis.timeaxis.timetick must not override datetime.datetime __init__ method (since datetime.datetime
    instances are immutable like ints)
- graph.style and graph.data modules
  - fix docu of gridattrs functionality of axis painters
    (how can one, e.g. draw a grid at the ticks and not at the subticks)
  - make graph.style.symbol.diamond a graph.style.symbol instance (to be discussed)
  - histogram style should be comptatible with numpy.histogram
- graph.data module:
  - use csv module (new in 2.3)
  - Check for "inf" and "nan" in datafiles.
    (When plotted, the graph does not complain, but the output will be broken;
    this depends on the plattform and is not only an issue within the graph system)
- graph.style module:
  - add styles using curves instead of lines
  - rework graph.style.arrow: size argument should be called length and arrowsize should be able to be controlled separately.
    one might also want to color-code the arrows
- graph.texter module:
  - rename period argument of decimal texters to recurring_decimal or something similar (as pointed out
    by Tim Head)
- canvas module:
  - stroking of patterns does not work in PDF
- style and color module:
  - support modification of existing styles via __call__
- bitmap module:
  - ReusableStreamDecode?
  - proper ASCII85Decode/HexDecode switch
- deformer module:
  - move helper path routines to some more generic place for paths?
- pdffile module needed (similar to epsfile)
- open discussion:
  - clearly distingish between readers and writers. dvifile, epsfile, etc. might
    be renamed to dvireader, epsreader ...
  - support gsave and grestore in some way to make context handling easier?
- ps/pdfwriters:
  - support colorspace argument (like c.writeEPSfile("bla", colorspace="cmyk"))
- move pyx.def, lfs-files etc. into a new share directory
- write fakepattern.py which substitutes some of the pattern functionality using
  re-usable canvases
- libkpathsea bindung:
  - create a ctypes based binding to replace the extension module implementation in the long

Documentation:
  - path module:
    - describe + vs << vs join
    - more details in path constructor: allowed pathels, first pathel...
    - set method
  - pattern module:
    - check and update
  - graphics section:
    Changeable attributes should be explained at a central place.
  - box module:
    - linealign and circlealign
    - need to be redone anyway
  - graph module:
    styles: document what data name the styles accept (require). Try also to be more
    userfriendly and not to describe immediately the internals of the implementation:
    (see e.g. class.style.symbol)
  - document interface to access tick positions

Examples:
  - add an epsfile example (suggested by Stathis Sideris)
  - add a small example line on y="f($1)" in one of the plot examples

FAQ:
  - describe creation and modification (inplace and ``modify by new'') of
    graph data
