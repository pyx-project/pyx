Plotting a function graph

Here, we explain how to plot the graph of a real-valued mathematical function of
a single real parameter. ...

As in the previous example, we first create a `graph.graphxy` instance passing
the width as argument. We then pass a `graph.data.function` instance to the
`plot` method of the graph. As first argument, we pass the function in the form
"y(x) = f(x)". Here, the left-hand side of the equation defines which parameter
is independent (here: `x`) and which one is dependent (here: `y`). We also need
to inform PyX about the range of the independent variable. This is done by passing
the parameters `min` and `max`.

! In order to increase the resolution of the function graph, you can use the
parameter `points` of the `graph.data.function` class to increase the number of
sampling points from its default value of `100`.

Note that the default graph style for function data is `graph.style.line` since
PyX assumes a continuous x-range. 

! You only need to pass the `min` and `max` parameters to the
`graph.data.function` class, if PyX cannot figure out an axis range by itself.
Thus, an alternative way to achieve the above result would look like
    g = graph.graphxy(width=8, x=graph.axis.linear(min=-15, max=15))
    g.plot(graph.data.function("y(x)=sin(x)/x"))
Here, we explicitely define an x-axis range by passing an appropriate
argument to the `x` parameter of the `graph.graphxy` class.

! For PyX it does not matter, whether you plot a function of a parameter `x` or
a parameter `y`. Thus, you may as well write
    g.plot(graph.data.function("x(y)=sin(y)/y", min=-15, max=15))
to obtain a plot where the y-coordinate is the independent one.
