PyX examples

The following examples are part of the PyX release __version__. For each PyX
example the source code and the corresponding output are shown. You can take a
guided tour through all examples by the ''prev'' and ''next'' links on the
upper right. All the examples and their descriptions are included in the source
distribution of PyX in the examples subdirectory.

! Some paragraphs (like the one you're just reading) are marked with a
''dangerous bend sign''. Some people will recognize this classification from
the TeXbook by D.E. Knuth and we use it at the PyX example pages for the same
purpose. The bend marks parts of the description, which require some experiences
with PyX. On the other hand, those parts can savely be ignored by PyX beginners.

!! There are even some paragraphs marked as ''doubly dangerous''. The explanations
given in those paragraphs provide some deeper insights of what's really going
on, but are not important for the average PyX user.
