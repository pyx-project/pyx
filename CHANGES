PyX

- ATT: refactoring of attributes in progress!!!

TODO:
  - graph module
    - rect style (and errorbars?) should use clipping (TODO: should they or do the now?)
    - do not include unneeded line segments when the axis range is set manually
    - allow for an iteration of a graph style, when it is used several times
    - symbols should become decorators
    - common bboxes for different graphs
    - automatic datafile key title
    - exceptions in drawsymbol & friends...
    - 3d graphs, circular graphs
    - symbols + lines -> symbollines (??). Symbols should not allow setting lineattrs, and
      lines not symbolattrs
    - allow for graph.changesymbol.square(size=0.15) etc.
    - rect style (and errorbars?) should use clipping
    - paths are to be drawn instead of inserted
  - style module:
    - default patterns
    - make dash length available
  - text module:
    - SlantFont & Co support
    - keep an eye on PEP 324 (popen 5): it could make the texrunner stuff much easier
  - mathtree module:
     - consider rewrite using the python compiler module
  - bbox module:
     - __iadd__ and inplace enlarge, transform,...
  - path module:
    - reverse needs to be fixed
    - there should be a path._at, path._begin, path._end
    - use math.degrees and math.radians
  - data module:
    - data.data should add line number like data.datafile
    - use csv module (new in 2.3)
  - canvas module:
    - multi page PostScript output
  - connnector module:
    - use math.degrees and math.radians instead of self-written functions
      (try to be compatible with old python versions, we should consider
      support down to python2.0!)

0.5 (????/??/??):
  - setup.py and distribution:
    - allow customization of the extension modules built (via setup.cfg)
    - disable building pykpathsea module by default
