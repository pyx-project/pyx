PyX

0.4 (????/??/??):
  TODOs:
  - manual:
    - include sources in source distribution
  - graph module:
    - tick.text is renamed to tick.label (in progress), ticks and labels will become tickpos/tickdist and labelpos/labeldist in partitioning
    - separate texter out of the axispainter (in progress)
    TODO:
    - do not include unneeded line segments when the axis range is set manually
    - allow for an iteration of a graph style, when it is used several times
    - common bboxes for different graphs
    - automatic datafile key title
    - exceptions in drawsymbol & friends...
    - 3d graphs, circular graphs
    - dense -> density
    - symbols + lines -> symbollines (??). Symbols should not allow setting lineattrs, and
      lines not symbolattrs
    - rect style (and errorbars?) should use clipping
  - canvas module:
    - default patterns
    - stroke and fill should support trafos
    - make dash length available
    - shouldn't strokepath/fillpath be validated by "strokepath is not None" instead of just "strokepath"
  - text module:
    - pdf(la)tex support (will hopefully lead to markers in text)
    - reset() method for the texrunner (done except for the documentation)
    TODO:
    - the prolog method of the dvifile class recieves the page now -> return the prolog needed by this page only
    - further improve lfs handling
  - tex module:
    - bugfix \def\ProcessPyXBox -> \long\def\ProcessPyXBox
    - copy lfs handling from text module (share the same source???)
  - data module:
    - full documentation via doc strings
    - data.data should add line number like data.datafile

  enhancements:
  - box module:
    - multiple radii (up to two per point) and softnesses
      (TODO: documentation)

  bugfixes:
  - text module:
    - derive TFMError and DVIError correctly from exceptions.Exception
  - box module:
    - correct rounding algorithm (Michael Schindler)
  - graph module:
    - refer to the graphs texrunner instead of the defaulttexrunner

0.3.1 (2003/04/04):
  - text module:
    - fix bug in dvi rule code where width was height
    - fix preamble attribute checking bug

  - data module:
    - allow for tuples in arguments of the data class
    - convenience: exchanged order of named parameters in data.data
  - graph module:
    - convenience: allow for part=None in _axis (base of linaxis and logaxis)
  - examples:
    - added a latex example (requested)
    - added a attributechange example (requested)
    - added back the integral example (requested; prior PyX 0.3 it was part of the user manual)
    - small change in vector example (allow for the access to the texrunner)
    - examples included in source distribution
  - canvas module:
    - correct arrow template calculation for very short paths

  - text module:
    - new module: a new and preferable integration of TeX/LaTeX
  - t1strip module:
    - strip glyphs from pfa/pfb-fonts
    - there is a C implementation taken from pdftex

    - allow for missing data in bar graphs -> skipmissing parameter
    - remove the support for variables given as keyword arguments in data constructor

  - unit module:
    - new classes for visual and width lengths, aliases for user length (u_pt = pt)
    - all length classes have now by default a quantifier 1 (instead of 0), such that,
      for instance, 5*unit.t_cm() == unit.t_cm(5)
    - default_unit now has to be set via unit.set. For instance: unit.set(defaultunit="m").
    - convert_to is now an internal function, which moreover does not longer accept tuples or lists
  - bbox module:
    - new class _bbox (the former bbox) which accepts points in the constructor. This is used
      for internal purposes.
    - the bbox constructor now accepts user lengths in the constructor.
    - new methods height, width, top, bottom, left, right
    - ll & ur ???, what about ul and lr -> ugly!

    - never reduce bbox upon output
    - defered TODOs:
      __iadd__ and inplace enlarge, transform,...

    - canvas.insert() now supports arguments
    - bbox of canvas can be specified in writetofile command explicitely
    - writetofile does not return self anymore
    - arrow template now uses intersection with circle to get size right
      (as per a suggestion by Michael Schindler)
  - mathtree module:
    - added abs function
    - changed the handling of extern functions and all variables
  - color module:
    - gradient renamed to palette
  - numerous bugfixes:

    - disable rating for labelattrs equals None (graph module)
    - defaultstyle selection, when a list of data is provided to the plot function (graph module)
    - traverse when adding functions as arguments of operators (mathtree module)
    - allow for extern functions in addcolumn (data module)
    - just one common place for the version number
    - fix incorrect exception name MathError (path module)
    - prevent double return of intersections for closed sub paths
    - ...

    - testsuite
  - mathtree module:
    - extern variables and functions (support in graph.function, graph.paramfunction and data.data)

    - deferred to Version 0.3
    - running TeX "on the fly" is basically implemented
  - numerous bugfixes:
    - transformation bug (#624068, trafo module)
    - canvas transformations (canvas module???)
