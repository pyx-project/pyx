PyX

0.3 (????/??/??):
  - examples
    - new easy to use example generation (will hopefully lead to nice examples)
  - unit box:
    - new module for handling of convex polygons (taken out of the graph module)
  - unit helper:
    - new module containing a collection of helper functions (taken out of the graph module)
    - moved the attrlist into helper -- as plain functions; attrlist becomes obsolete
  - text module:
    - new module: a new and preferable integration of TeX/LaTeX
  - t1strip module:
    - strip glyphs from pfa/pfb-fonts
    - there is a C implementation taken from pdftex
    - fallback solution via an external program (pfb2pfa)
  - pykpathsea module:
    - (partial) C binding to libkpathsea
    - fallback solution via an external program (kpsewhich)
  - graph module:
    - removed some code duplication (various axis painters)
    - use text module instead of the obsolete tex module
    - allow for tailing zeros of automatic generated labels
    - allow for missing data in bar graphs -> skipmissing parameter
    - remove the support for variables given as keyword arguments in data constructor
    - use context instead of extern for extern variables and functions
    - graph keys; titles in data/function/etc.
    - deferred TODOs:
      - common bboxes for different graphs
      - automatic datafile key title
      - exceptions in drawsymbol & friends...
      - separate texter out of the axispainter
      - 3d graphs
  - unit module:
    - new classes for visual and width lengths, aliases for user length (u_pt = pt)
    - all length classes have now by default a quantifier 1 (instead of 0), such that,
      for instance, 5*unit.t_cm() == unit.t_cm(5)
    - default_unit now has to be set via unit.set. For instance: unit.set(defaultunit="m").
    - convert_to is now internal function, which moreover does not longer accept tuples or lists
  - bbox module:
    - new methods height, width, top, bottom, left, right
    - ll & ur ???, what about ul and lr -> ugly!
    - enlarge (was enhance) now allows selective enlargement to the left, bottom, right and top
    - output HiResBoundingBox
    - never reduce bbox upon output
    - TODO: document me!
  - epsfile module:
    - new constructor signature, more in line with rest of PyX:
      epsfile(x, y, filename, **additional_args)
  - data module:
    - removed additional column support in addcolumn; removed _addcolumn (done except for the documentation)
    - line reduction for datafile like the every parameter in gnuplot (done except for the documentation)
  - canvas module:
    - new way of PS prolog generation that writes only necessary parts
    - added support for patterns
    - canvas.insert() now supports arguments
    - bbox of canvas can be specified in writetofile command explicitely
    - writetofile does not return self anymore
    - TODO: document patterns and new writetofile syntax
  - mathtree module:
    - added abs function
    - changed the handling of extern functions and all variables
  - color module:
    - gradient renamed to palette
  - numerous bugfixes:
    - problem with sizefile on windows (tex module)
    - allow for strings in graphxy's width and height; allow for width only (graph module)
    - disable rating for labelattrs equals None (graph module)
    - defaultstyle selection, when a list of data is provided to the plot function (graph module)
    - traverse when adding functions as arguments of operators (mathtree module)
    - allow for extern functions in addcolumn (data module)
    - just one common place for the version number
    - ...

0.2 (2003/01/17):
  - unit module:
    - allow division of length by numbers
  - trafo module:
    - new transformation: slant
    - renamed all trafo methods to use the participle (i.e translate->translated)
    - the name of all trafo subclasses are verbs (i.e. translation->translate)
  - graph module:
    - mark class renamed to symbol
    - (text-)box distance measurement
    - moved axis partitioning to axis and axis painter
    - automatic axis partitioning (now officially: general cleanup, distance measurement, documentation)
    - splitaxis
    - baraxis, baraxispainter, and bar style
  - data module:
    - previously named datafile module
    - class "_datafile" renamed to class "data"
    - class sectionfile added
    - testsuite
  - mathtree module:
    - extern variables and functions (support in graph.function, graph.paramfunction and data.data)
    - testsuite
  - text module:
    - deferred to Version 0.3
    - running TeX "on the fly" is basically implemented
  - numerous bugfixes:
    - transformation bug (#624068, trafo module)
    - canvas transformations (canvas module???)
    - textbox alignment (graph module)
    - return linewidth upon calculation with linewidths (unit module)
    - allow column number variables with several digits
    - ...
  - british and american spellings (color module, graph module)
  - small logo modifications
